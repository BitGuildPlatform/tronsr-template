  BitGuild is a team of blockchain and gaming industry veterans that aims to create the go-to platform for blockchain gaming and entertainment. We believe that next-generation blockchains like TRON will finally allow us to build the application layer of the blockchain. At BitGuild, our goal is to create fun, useful applications that can help take cryptocurrency mainstream.

Through the power of blockchain, BitGuild redefines what it means to own digital assets in video games (characters, items, gold, etc). Our mission is to bring together the existing cryptogaming crowd with more traditional PC, console, and mobile gaming audiences by providing a single destination for users to find the best blockchain gaming experiences out there.

We successfully completed our initial token sale in April 2018, raising over $20 million USD in public and private funding. Our platform is open to all, and currently hosts a variety of games for cryptocurrency gamer/aficionados to enjoy.

## Why BitGuild for Super Representative?
  As a gaming and entertainment company, we represent one of the industries that is most apt at pushing new technologies into mainstream markets, and as such, we are a perfect choice for TRON Super Representative status. BitGuild will promote TRON awareness to wider audiences by developing and hosting fun and compelling games, community interactions, and offering real-world adoption avenues for TRON, TRX, and cryptocurrency in general.

BitGuild and TRON have collaborated in the past, and BitGuildâ€™s status as a TRON Super Representative is one of many steps we hope to take in solidifying our partnership with TRON and the TRX community.
